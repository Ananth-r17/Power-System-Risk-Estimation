The power system operational risk had multiple features which contained data defining the feature and risk associated with it. In Task 1, data preprocessing was performed to eliminate all the abnormalities from the data and selecting features that had maximum impact using data scaling, outlier detection, target class imbalance resolution and encoding. In Task 2, a model valuation was developed to predict the risk factor (R). Among the models tested, SVR with the RBF Kernel emerged as the standout in terms of performance with highest R2 score. The model was further fine-tuned via GridSearchCV, and overfitting was managed through K-Fold Cross Validation, to create a reliable model. In Task 3, risk classes were predicted. The Multi-Layer Perceptron Classifier (MLP) model demonstrated highest performance, particularly in terms of recall score, making it, a the preferred choice. We used the LBFGS solver and RELU activation function as they performed the best. Hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV and avoiding overfitting through K-fold cross-validation enhanced the model’s performance scores. The primary metric for checking this model’s success was the recall score, ensuring that it effectively prioritized safety and risk mitigation.
